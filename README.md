this site will have the purpose of logging mood, feelings, productivity. This app will make it easier to visualize your daily, weekly and monthly progress to motivate you to keep going and completing tasks

It will have 3 daily goals that once checked they change the monthly counter and show a progression bar toward your monthly goal. So like if you study 2 hours today and your monthly goal was to study 30 hours the progression bar would change from 0% to 2/30=6.66%. If you change the goal to for example 40 hours then the 2 hours you studied would still be accounted for but it would become 2/40=5%.

The weekly goal, if your monthly goal is 30 hours studied would have to be 30/4=7.5 hours per week.

my monthly goal of exercising 20 days of the month, studying like 30 hours a month and maybe something with eating healthy
